    .vue files require webpack
    as such
    If you are just setting up vue using the cdn you need to use vue({}) and vue.componenet()



    you can import function etc. using a script tag and the src attribute
    just add it below the template 
     [also works for CSS]
    


Why is data a function that returns an object?
    Scope
    Otherwise every instance of that component would share the same data 

    Vue Projects [Trello Clone] [[Little bit more than just a todo list]]
        Use router
        Write Tests

    One page displays all the projects that a users has
    Second page displays that project along with the tasks
        [To-Do, In Progress, Completed]
    Components
        -Task [card with a select to change the task status]
        -Project [rendered on home page]


    Day 1.5:

    On first page load grab the Projects Data [Project Title and Project ID]

    When you navigate to a project pull down the tasks and render them into lists 

    Ability to move the tasks from list to list [Check]

    Button to Create a new task [Done]
        Done from inside taskList
        ;) focus on input when it is rendered onto the page 


    Button to create a new List [Done]
        Dynamically create the task lists


        ***LOOP OVER TASK OPTIONS IN SEPERATETAKS PROJECT.JS*** [v] 

    What's done?

        Navigate to different projects
        Work on projects without existing tasks
        Move data to different task lists
        Create new tasks
        Create new task lists

    Next Steps:





    DB Structure:


    user{
        allProjects:{
            uid: {projectTitle: string},
        },
        projects{
            uid: {
                title: String,
                tasks: [] Array
            }
        }
    }


    Task: 




    DUMP
    projects: [
        {
          id: 0,
          title: "the-stand",
          taskItems: [
            { taskId: 0, status: "To-Do", title: "Fix Thing" },

            { taskId: 1, status: "In Progress", title: "Auth" },
            { taskId: 2, status: "Completed", title: "Other" },
            { taskId: 3, status: "To-Do", title: "Fix Other Thing" },
          ],
          taskStatusTypes: ["To-Do", "In Progress", "Completed"],
        },
        { id: 1, title: "portfolio" },
        { id: 2, title: "f-w" },
      ],
